# Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on the Google V8 JavaScript engine. It was first released in 2009 by Ryan Dahl, and has since become one of the most popular technologies for building scalable, high-performance web applications.

## Features

Node.js offers several features that make it a great choice for web development, including:

- **Fast**: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that allows it to handle a large number of connections with high throughput and low latency.

- **Scalable**: Node.js applications are highly scalable due to their asynchronous, event-driven nature. This means that they can handle large amounts of traffic without degrading performance.

- **Flexible**: Node.js can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including web servers, command-line tools, desktop applications, and more.

- **NPM**: Node.js comes with the Node Package Manager (NPM), which makes it easy to find, install, and manage third-party libraries and modules.

## Getting started

To get started with Node.js, you'll need to install it on your system. Node.js is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and can be downloaded from the official website at https://nodejs.org/en/.

Once you have Node.js installed, you can start creating your first application. Node.js applications are typically built using JavaScript, so if you're familiar with the language, you should feel right at home.

## Example

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Node.js:

```javascript
// Load the HTTP module
const http = require('http');

// Create an HTTP server that listens on port 8080
http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello, World!');
}).listen(8080);

console.log('Server running at http://localhost:8080/');
